# ABOUT THIS FORK
While following along with the graphics programming course, I have also implemented a custom networking solution.

The sever project is in the "Server" folder.

Uses a somewhat-authoritative server model. Supports ~ 4 players.

Wanted to focus on low-level packet transmission and the server routine.
